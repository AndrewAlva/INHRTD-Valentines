## Built using Ometeotl.
Framework to build visual-oriented websites allowing 3D and 2D animations. Meant to speed up frontend development, take care of the repetitive setup and make it easy and enjoyable to display animations and graphics.

## TODO.
#### Features.
##### Core.
* Fast building (Pug templates?)
* Fast styling (SCSS support)
* Organized js classes
* 3D engines support (three.js)
* Import/manage glsl files (##require, ##pragma?)

## Nice to have's.
* Dynamic page transitions (AJAX / Taxi.js?)
* Lazy loading for images
* Fast first content visible (split js files?)
* DOM-GL (sync between HTML DOM tree and WebGL)
